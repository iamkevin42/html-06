<div id="psu">
    The PSU short for Power Supply Unit which is responsible for converting electrical energy into from an external power source until the right amount is needed to power different components within the PC.
    The main functions of a PSU include:
    <br>
<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">
    1. AC to DC Conversion: The PSU's primary function is to convert the AC power from the electrical outlet into DC power. This is accomplished through a process called rectification, where the AC voltage is converted into a pulsating DC voltage.
    <br>
    2. Filtering and Regulation: The pulsating DC voltage generated by rectification is not suitable for powering electronic components directly. The PSU includes components such as capacitors, inductors, and voltage regulators to filter out the fluctuations and noise from the DC voltage and regulate it to provide stable and clean power to the computer components.
    <br>
    3. Distribution: Once the DC voltage has been filtered and regulated, the PSU distributes the power to various components of the computer system, including the motherboard, CPU, GPU, storage drives, and peripherals. This is achieved through different connectors and cables, such as ATX, SATA, PCIe, and peripheral connectors.
    <br>
    4. Safety Features: Modern PSUs include safety features to protect both the PSU and the computer components from electrical faults and power fluctuations. These features include over-voltage protection, under-voltage protection, over-current protection, short-circuit protection, and over-temperature protection.
    <br>
    5. Efficiency: PSUs come with efficiency ratings, such as 80 Plus Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. These ratings indicate how efficiently the PSU converts AC power into DC power. Higher efficiency ratings result in less wasted energy, reduced heat generation, and lower electricity bills.
    <br>
    6. Fan Cooling: Many PSUs include a cooling fan to dissipate heat generated during operation. The fan helps maintain the PSU's temperature within safe limits and ensures reliable operation.

    A GPU or Graphics Processing Unit is an electronic circuit built to alter image accerlation in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. 
    These 7 steps explain how a GPU works and how it's important:
    <br>
<div style="font-size: 18px; text-align: left;">
    1. Parallel Processing Architecture: GPUs are built with hundreds to thousands of small processing units called "cores" or "stream processors." These cores are designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making GPUs highly parallel processors. This architecture allows GPUs to perform many computations in parallel, which is essential for rendering complex graphics quickly.
    <br>
    2. Vertex Processing: When rendering 3D graphics, the GPU first processes the vertices (or points) of 3D objects in the scene. This involves transforming the vertices into 2D coordinates relative to the camera's viewpoint, applying transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.
    <br>
    3. Primitive Assembly: Once the vertices are processed, the GPU assembles them into geometric primitives, such as triangles or polygons. These primitives form the basic building blocks of 3D objects in the scene.
    <br>
    4.Rasterization: The GPU then rasterizes the geometric primitives into pixels, determining which pixels are covered by each primitive. This process involves determining the color, depth, and other attributes of each pixel based on the properties of the primitives and their interaction with light sources and materials.
    5. Fragment Processing: After rasterization, the GPU processes each pixel, or fragment, to determine its final color and other attributes. This involves applying lighting models, textures, shading techniques, and other visual effects to simulate the appearance of the 3D scene.
    <br>
    6. Output to Frame Buffer: Finally, the processed pixels are written to a frame buffer, a region of memory that stores the final image to be displayed on the screen. The contents of the frame buffer are periodically sent to the display device to update the screen with the latest rendered image.
    <br>
    7. Graphics APIs: GPUs communicate with the CPU and software applications through graphics APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as DirectX, OpenGL, and Vulkan. These APIs provide a standardized way for software developers to interact with the GPU, allowing them to create complex graphical applications and games.
