    All the parts you need to build a functioning PC are: a motherboard, cpu, ram, psu, gpu, a hard drive, a case, case fans, storage, and a cpu cooler. I will go over all of these parts in order for what they are and how they work.
    <br>
    <br>
<div id="motherboard"> 
    The motherboard is the heart of computer keeping all the internal components connected together such as the cpu, gpu, memory, storage, etc. The motherboard supplies energy throughout the PC and facilitates all communication between all computer of the components. The motherboard has 10 main functions that the computer relies on it to have:

<div id="cpu">
    The cpu is essentially the brains of the PC and gives orders on what to and how to do it. A cpu is usually built with various of main components such as a: a control unit, an arithmeic/logic unit(ALU), register set, Cache Memory, and Clock. All these components work together to process data and make sure the computer runs all of it's programs properly and to perform multiple tasks at once.
    <br>
    The CPU has several steps that allow it to execute instructions and perform calculations:
<div style="text-align: left;">
    1. Fetch: The CPU retrieves instructions from the computer's memory (RAM) or cache. These instructions are stored as binary code and represent specific operations that the CPU needs to perform.
    <br>
    2. Decode: The fetched instructions are decoded by the CPU to determine what operation needs to be performed and what data is required for the operation.
    <br>
    3. Execute: The CPU executes the decoded instructions by performing arithmetic, logic, or data movement operations. Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical operations involve comparisons and bitwise manipulations. Data movement operations move data between different memory locations or registers.
    <br>
    4. Write Back: After executing the instruction, the CPU may write the results back to memory or to internal registers for further processing or storage.
    <br>
<div id="ram">
    RAM or Random-Access-Memory is a storage that holds data and machine code that is being used by the cpu. Ram is generally faster than hard drives and SSDs but loses the stored data when the PC is off. There is 6 main steps on how ram works:
<div style="text-align: left;">
    1. Storage of Data and Instructions: RAM is composed of memory cells that can store binary data (0s and 1s). Each memory cell can hold a single binary digit, known as a bit. These memory cells are organized into rows and columns, forming a matrix.
    <br>
    2. Addressing: Each memory cell in RAM has a unique address that the CPU can use to access it. The CPU sends a memory address along with a read or write command to the RAM, indicating which memory cell it wants to access.
    <br>
    3. Read and Write Operations: RAM supports both read and write operations. When the CPU needs to read data from RAM, it sends a memory address to the RAM module, and the RAM returns the data stored at that address. When the CPU needs to write data to RAM, it sends the data along with the memory address where it wants to store the data.
    <br>
    4. Volatility: RAM is volatile memory, meaning that it loses its stored data when the power is turned off. This is in contrast to non-volatile storage devices like hard drives or SSDs, which retain data even when the power is off.
    <br>
    6.Cache Hierarchy: In modern computer systems, there is often a hierarchy of cache memory between the CPU and RAM. Cache memory is smaller but faster than RAM, and it stores frequently accessed data and instructions to further improve CPU performance. The CPU first checks the cache for data it needs before accessing data from RAM.
